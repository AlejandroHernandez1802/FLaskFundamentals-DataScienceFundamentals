# FLaskFundamentals-DataScienceFundamentals

This is the repository where I put all the three task assigned by the teacher about Flask micro framework. 
There are .py and .html files. In my local repository, the .html files are in a /templates folder, but to make the upload easier I just upload all the files together. Each task have a representative name alluding to the assignment. 

If there's an error, please send me a message to: u20181165894@usco.edu.co
